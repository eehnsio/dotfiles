# dotfiles

Collection of my configs and settings for some applications

# Structure

Each directory represents a package that can be independently stowed:

```
.dotfiles/
├── ghostty/          # Terminal emulator
├── nvim/             # Neovim editor
```

# Stow

Each folder should be stowed using:

```
stow folder --target=$HOME -v
```

```

```
